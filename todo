Ordered TODO list:
    * Fix display of pipelines not working initially when attempting to run against a submission

	* Sample Groups should be able to access history of pipelines processed and trace the specific sample data groups
	* Pipeline Instance -> Data Source
	* Pipeline Instances -> Data Source

	* Pipeline Regex check (see if files contain the type that we need to run it)
	* File checking in current pipelines

	* Cycle demux pipeline until I am sure it is working
		* Attempt demux pipeline with a real world example
	* Cycle exome pipeline until I am sure it is working
		* Attempt align pipeline with a real world example

	* Build Pipeline Instance needs a source pipeline arg that can be null in the case of submissions

	* Download infrastructrue
		* SFTP infrastructure

	* Permissions for all data manipulations / access

	* Further test customer infrastructure
	* Email infrastructure

	* Pipeline Documentation text, documentation file

	* Harmonize data sources?
	* SampleGroup can be empty of samples, which is functionally correct but not semantically - Therefore data group? Samples can own data, Data Groups can be associated with samples, pipeline data is associated with data groups
		
	* Stats for module and pipeline execution
		* Additional data metrics / information in db entries and how to propagate from submissions
	* Data management (group admin or submitter)
	* Quotas / Don't Delete - May not be correct anymore, reeval later
